# wopw (old Perl version)

ยง Description

I wrote a Perl-flavored emulator prior to the Node one because I deemed it necessary to pick up a new language at the time. This project is no longer being maintained and has only been uploaded for reference.

It is not a full-fledged emulator and is only compatible with the 2011 client.
